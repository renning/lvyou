Minimal black-and-white theme, mostly shaped by whitespace; no graphics.
Customizable sidebar and navigation menu.

== Description ==

Newsprint is a black-and-white theme, minimal in both appearance and
implementation. In fact, it's the simplest WordPress theme that can
possibly work! As such, it's a good starting point for learning to
make your own. It does have basic features such as custom sidebar and
menus. Probably works best with lots of colorful images in the content.

== Installation ==

First, download Newsprint from the
[WordPress Theme Directory](http://wordpress.org/extend/themes/).
Then, you can do one of the following:

1. Navigate to the Appearance -> Themes administration panel on your
blog; go to the Install Themes tab, then to Upload, and follow the
instructions. Failing that...
2. Unpack the downloaded archive; log in to the server where you have
installed WordPress (e.g. via FTP); upload the tanabi-comics directory
to wp-content/themes.
